- This is a donation pool, so delegators get zero rewards. The pool operator takes 100% margin.

- This is a clean case of preference-based demand. Donation pools can be bundled incentive schemes, confounding pure altruism. Narrative-driven reallocation of stake creates system-level externalities in decentralization.

- Funding is highly concentrated in a top delegator. The pool faces funding concentration risk.

- We quantify funding concentration using HHI and top-holder shares. Large delegation exits create run-like cashflow shocks.
